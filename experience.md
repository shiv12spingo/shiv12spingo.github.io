### Research Assistant @ C-MInDS, IIT Bombay
Duration: May '22 - Jun '23

Lab: Solidification and CoDeS (Computational and Data-enabled Simulations)

Took the initiative to perform novel interdisciplinary AI research specifically in the field of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving complex problems by developing data-driven models incorporating process information

Impact: Developed an improved methodology for solving moving boundary systems such as the binary alloy solidfication problem not solvable via conventional PINN approaches. Pre-print research article available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10910).
