### Photoelasticity
This project was done in a team as part of Term Paper Presentation for the course MM203: Mechanics of Materials. We analysed research papers on photoelasticity involving quantitative stress measurement, visualisation & interpretation. We explored concepts of birefringence, stress isoclinics & isochromatics and I specifically studied the types of stresses in glass. We delivered the presentation to explain it to our class and demonstrated the specific application of photoelasticity to determine stresses in glass.

### Reusing Waste Milk Bags
This was a group course project for MM152: Materials & Technology. We developed containers and a raincoat by reusing waste milk bags made of LDPE, a hydrophobic material. We used a hot air gun to melt the edges of cut-outs of plastic bag and simultaneously applied metal roller to join them. Thus the eco-friendly raincoat was developed at low cost by welding single layers of uniform pieces of these bags collected from hostel mess waste and its strength & water repulsion was successfully tested under a shower.
