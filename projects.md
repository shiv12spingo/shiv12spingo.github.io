### Smart Materials & Manufacturing 4.0 (Seminar Project)
As part of the Seminar course (MM396), I researched on the different types of smart materials and their relevance with Manufacturing 4.0 in focus. I developed an official report and delivered a presentation to my guide and the examiner.
### Terrorism: Data Analysis & Predictive Modelling
This was a Data Science (DS203) course project done in pairs. After literature survey, we analysed the Global Terrorism Database with effective visualisations. Thereafter, we built predictive Machine Learning models using country-wise annual data from other sources on political, social and economic factors influencng terrorism.
### Columbia Disaster & Learnings from Failure
This was a Term Paper Project done in team as part of the course MM327: Mechanical Behaviour of Materials. We investigated why and how did the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occur. We analysed the materials used in the structure and their functions. Specifically, I demonstrated how the failure analysis of materials was carried out and the conclusions derived from it. We highlighted the learnings from this mission's failure. 
### Battery Cycle Life Prediction (Internship Project)
Coulomb AI is a startup in Battery Data Intelligence. I learnt and developed machine learning models for predicting the battery (cycle) life as a ML research intern. 
### Hydrogen Storage Technologies (Internship Project)
As part of my summer internship at Airbus, I presented a comparative analysis of hydrogen storage materials for aviation, after going through research papers.
### 2D Materials (Literature Review Project)
As part of Maths & Physics Club's Summer of Science, I researched on 2D Materials with focus on graphene and energy storage and documented my study as a report. 
### Photoelasticity (Term Paper Presentation)
This project was done in a team as part of Term Paper Presentation for the course MM203: Mechanics of Materials. We analysed research papers on photoelasticity involving quantitative stress measurement, visualisation & interpretation. We explored concepts of birefringence, stress isoclinics & isochromatics and I specifically studied the types of stresses in glass. We delivered a presentation to explain it to our class and I demonstrated the specific application of photoelasticity to determine stresses in glass.
### High Energy Density Magnetic Materials
As part of the In-Semester Undergraduate Research Project, I researched on rare-earth-free permanent magnet systems (Mn-Al-C and MnBi) with high energy densities. 
### Tabbing App (Web-App Development Project)
As part of Web & Coding Club's Seasons of Code, I developed a web app for debate tournaments using Django framework (HTML+Python+CSS) in a team of 3 students. 
### Reusing Waste Milk Bags (Course Project)
This was a group course project for MM152: Materials & Technology. We collected waste milk bags from hostel mess, washed them and cut-out uniformly-sized pieces. Utilising the hydrophobic nature of LDPE, the material from which these bags are made, we developed an eco-friendly raincoat at low cost by welding such pieces. We used a hot air gun to melt the edges of these cut-outs and simultaneously applied metal roller to join them. Later we successfully tested its strength & hydrophobicity under a shower.
