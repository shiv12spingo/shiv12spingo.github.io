### Photoelasticity
This project was done in a team as part of Term Paper Presentation for the course MM203: Mechanics of Materials. We analysed research papers on photoelasticity involving quantitative stress measurement, visualisation & interpretation. We explored concepts of birefringence, stress isoclinics & isochromatics and I specifically studied the types of stresses in glass. We delivered the presentation to explain it to our class and demonstrated the specific application of photoelasticity to determine stresses in glass.

### Reusing Waste Milk Bags
This was a group course project for MM152: Materials & Technology. We collected waste milk bags from hostel mess, washed them and cut-out uniformly-sized pieces. Utilising the hydrophobic nature of LDPE, the material from which these bags are made, we developed an eco-friendly raincoat at low cost by welding such pieces. We used a hot air gun to melt the edges of these cut-outs and simultaneously applied metal roller to join them. Later we successfully tested its strength & hydrophobicity under a bathroom shower.
