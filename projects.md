### Photoelasticity
This project was done in a team as part of Term Paper Presentation for the course MM203: Mechanics of Materials. We analysed research papers on photoelasticity involving quantitative stress measurement, visualisation & interpretation. We explored concepts of birefringence, stress isoclinics & isochromatics and I specifically studied the types of stresses in glass. We demonstrated the specific application of photoelasticity to determine stresses in glass.
