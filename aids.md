I had contested for the position of Head of the [Data Analytics and Visualisation (DAV) Team, IIT Bombay](https://in.linkedin.com/company/dav-team-iit-bombay) in Summer 2022. As part of the procedure for selection, I had done few assignments. One of them was performing Exploratory Data Analysis on the [Barcelona 2017 Accidents Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xvivancos/barcelona-data-sets). Here is my [notebook]() for the same and you can view my presentation here.
