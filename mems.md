### Reusing Waste Milk Bags
As part of the introductory Materials & Technology course, our team made a raincoat by reusing waste milk bags. I delivered my version of our team's presentation at the Virtual Research Symposium by Students (VRSS) conducted by the IITBâ€™s Undergraduate Academic Council (UGAC) in Feb 2021. Excited to know how we did it? Check out the below presentation.
